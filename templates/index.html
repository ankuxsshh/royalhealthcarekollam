            <p class="justify-content-center justify-text" data-aos="fade-right">Royal Healthcare, located in Chathannoor, Kollam, Kerala, has been a trusted healthcare provider since 2005. Our mission is simple: to deliver exceptional medical care and improve the health of our community. Over the years, we have earned a reputation for compassionate care, modern facilities, and a dedicated team committed to enhancing the well-being of those we serve.

              In 2016, we temporarily closed for a comprehensive renovation to upgrade our facilities and expand our services. However, the completion of our plans was delayed, especially due to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, we offered our facility to the government as a dedicated COVID-19 care center to support local efforts.</p>

                    <p class="fst-italic">Anesthesia is a medical practice that involves administering drugs to prevent pain during surgeries, procedures, or diagnostic tests. It can be classified into three main types: general anesthesia, which induces a state of unconsciousness; regional anesthesia, which numbs a specific part of the body; and local anesthesia, which numbs a small area.</p>
                    <p>Anesthetics work by blocking nerve signals, allowing patients to undergo procedures without experiencing pain. Anesthesia is carefully managed by anesthesiologists to ensure patient safety and comfort, considering factors such as the type of procedure, the patient's health, and potential side effects.</p>
